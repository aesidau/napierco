            <h3>History</h3>
              <p>The orchestra was founded in the 1990's by Paul Green (who still plays with us) as a string ensemble. Over the years the orchestra has grown to be a full symphony orchestra.</p>
              <p>During this time, the orchestra performed under several names including Napier Chamber Orchestra, Napier Concert Orchestra and Napier Community Orchestra. However, in 2012 it established itself as the Essendon Symphony.</p>
              <p>Previous conductors have included:
              <ul>
                <li><a href="http://www.paulfitzsimon.com/">Paul Fitzsimon</a></li>
                <li><a href="http://www.uwacs.com.au/current-conductor">Chris van Tuinen</a></li>
                <li><a href="http://zelmansymphony.org.au/Conductors/MarkShiell">Mark Sheill</a></li>
              </ul></p>
              <p>The Essendon Symphony is the only community-based orchestra in Melbourne's western suburbs. We are often looking for new players especially for violin, viola, double bass and brass.</p>
