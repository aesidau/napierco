<h1>We have a new conductor<br>
</h1>
<div class="text">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As nearly always happens, for we are an excellent training school for orchestral conductors, our <b>Paul Fitzsimon</b>&#160;has been hijacked by the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra as an assistant conductor and looks set to see his musical career advance apace.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Similar headhunting expeditions have carried off our two most recent conductor before Paul, namely <b>Chris van Tuinen&#160;</b> and <b>Mark Sheill.</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So it is with joyful anticipation that we welcome <b>Jenny Going</b> to the position and look forward to great and geater things both for her and for us as a group.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jenny comes to us having joined the brain drain from New Zealand to Australia in 2006. Upon leaving NZ, Jenny &#8216;retired&#8217; from life as a head of music to run Noteable &#8211; Music Education Resources. Jenny started her musical career as a trombonist with the NZ Navy Band. After leaving the Navy and obtaining a Psych degree (which has come in very useful for a lifetime with musicians), Jenny studied jazz trombone and conducting at the University of the Arts in Philadelphia. She has performed with, and conducted many groups from Big Bands, Orchestras and Concert Bands through to being musical director for a number of Musical Theatre productions. </p>
