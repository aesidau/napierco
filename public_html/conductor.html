<big><b><p>We have a new conductor</p></b></big>

<p>As nearly always happens, for we are an excellent training school for orchestral conductors, our <b>Paul Fitzsimon</b>&#160;has been hijacked by the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra as an assistant conductor and looks set to see his musical career advance apace.</p>

<p>Similar head hunting expeditions have carried off our two most recent conductor before Paul, namely <b>Chris van Tuinen&#160;</b> and <b>Mark Sheill.</b></p>

<p>So it is with joyful anticipation that we welcome <big><b>Jenny Going</b> </big>to the position and look forward to great and greater things both for her and for us as a group.</p>

<p>Jenny comes to us having joined the brain drain from New Zealand to Australia in 2006. Upon leaving NZ, Jenny retired from life as a head of music to run Noteable  Music Education Resources. Jenny started her musical career as a trombonist with the NZ Navy Band. After leaving the Navy and obtaining a Psych degree (which has come in very useful for a lifetime with musicians), Jenny studied jazz trombone and conducting at the University of the Arts in Philadelphia. She has performed with, and conducted many groups from Big Bands, Orchestras and Concert Bands through to being musical director for a number of Musical Theatre productions. </p>

This year marks the tenth anniversary of the Napier Chamber Orchestra. The orchestra was formed in 1997 from a group of local musicians meeting to provide orchestral accom­paniment to Carols by Candlelight held annually in Napier Park j in Essendon. In mid-1997 a core group of these players began meeting regularly to play music. The group cafled itself the d “Napier String Ensemble”. With one violin, a viola and two cel­los, the seeds of the “Napier Chamber Orchestra” were sown.
We and are always on the lookout for new members of any age with a recommended minimum standard equivalent to grade 4 or 5 AMEB. If you are interested please see a member or phone Ruth on 9331
4715 (after hours). You are welcome to “try us out. Even if you haven’t played your instru­ment for a while we encourage you to take it out of the cupboard and have a go.
Please add your name to our mailing list if you wish to be notified of future con­certs. We would be delighted to hear from anyone who is interested in forming and organ­ising an active “Friends of Napier Concert Orchestra” group to help raise community awareness and support.</pre>
